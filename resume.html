			For my resume, I wanted to make three brief sections:
			<ol type="1">
			<li>School</li>
			<li>Personal</li>
			<li>Professional</li>
			</ol>
			These are what I'm focused on as a 21 year old in Iowa City. They all seem
			to be going well so far. I hope you learn something new about me! Thanks 
			for reading.
